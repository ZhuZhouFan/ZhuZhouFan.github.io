      abstract={Style investing creates asset classes (or the so-called "styles") with low correlations, aligning well with the principle of "Holy Grail of investing" in terms of portfolio selection. The returns of styles naturally form a tensor-valued time series, which requires new tools for studying the dynamics of the conditional correlation matrix to facilitate the aforementioned principle. Towards this goal, we introduce a new tensor dynamic conditional correlation (TDCC) model, which is based on two novel treatments: trace-normalization and dimension-normalization. These two normalizations adapt to the tensor nature of the data, and they are necessary except when the tensor data reduce to vector data. Moreover, we provide an easy-to-implement estimation procedure for the TDCC model, and examine its finite sample performance by simulations. Finally, we assess the usefulness of the TDCC model in international portfolio selection across ten global markets and in large portfolio selection for 1800 stocks from the Chinese stock market.},

      abstract={We open up the "black-box" to identify the predictive general price patterns in price chart images via the deep learning image analysis techniques. Our identified price patterns lead to the construction of image-induced importance (triple-I) weights, which are applied to weighted moving average the existing price trend trading signals according to their level of importance in predicting price movements. From an extensive empirical analysis on the Chinese stock market, we show that the triple-I weighting scheme can significantly enhance the price trend trading signals for proposing portfolios, with a thoughtful robustness study in terms of network specifications, image structures, and stock sizes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the triple-I weighting scheme is able to propose long-term portfolios from a time-scale transfer learning, enhance the news-based trading strategies through a non-technical transfer learning, and increase the overall strength of numerous trading rules for portfolio selection.}
