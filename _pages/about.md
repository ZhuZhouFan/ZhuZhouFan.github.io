My name is Zhoufan Zhu (朱周帆). Welcome to my homepage.


***Research***: I am now an assistant professor at WISE & Department of Finance, Xiamen University. My recent research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence and finance. I am dedicated to designing advanced computational and machine learning algorithms for financial data analysis, primarily focusing on stock market data, to improve trading strategies and portfolio selection in the context of modern big data. My specific areas of focus include:

1) Developing multimodal learning algorithms (e.g., multimodal foundation models) to integrate multi-scale financial data for asset pricing and portfolio selection;

2) Building real-world learning systems to learn generalizable, trustworthy, and fair representations from imperfect financial data;

3) Creating causality-driven learning algorithms to address conformal prediction problems in complex financial data, improving their interpretability and safety for risk management.

***Previously***: Before joining Xiamen University, I earned my Ph.D. in Mathematical Statistics from the [School of Statistics and Management](https://ssm.sufe.edu.cn/main.htm) at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics in 2024, under the supervision of Prof. [Liwen Zhang (张立文)](https://ssm.sufe.edu.cn/9d/43/c716a236867/page.htm) and Prof. [Fan Zhou (周帆)](https://ssm.sufe.edu.cn/13/8a/c714a201610/page.htm). Between July 2022 and January 2024, I served as a Research Assistant in the [Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science](https://saasweb.hku.hk/) at The University of Hong Kong, where I had the honor of working under the guidance of Prof. [Ke Zhu (朱柯)](https://mazhuke.w3spaces.com/).
