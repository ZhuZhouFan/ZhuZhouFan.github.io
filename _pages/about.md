I am an assistant professor at WISE, Xiamen University. My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence and finance. We are dedicated to designing advanced computational and machine learning algorithms for financial data analysis, primarily focusing on time-series data, to improve trading strategies and portfolio selection in modern big data scenario. Specifically, we focus on: 


Before joining XMU, I earned my Ph.D. in Mathematical Statistics from the School of Statistics and Management at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics in 2024, under the supervision of Prof. [Liwen Zhang](https://ssm.sufe.edu.cn/ce/6e/c712a118382/page.htm). Between July 2022 and January 2024, I served as a Research Assistant in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at The University of Hong Kong, supervised by Prof. [Ke Zhu](https://mazhuke.w3spaces.com/). 

<!-- I was a postdoctoral research fellow at Stanford University, working with Prof. Lei Xing.


Guanghua School of Management, Peking University in 2023, under the supervision of Prof. Hansheng Wang. 


I obtained my Ph.D. degree in SHUFE, The Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2019 and the B.Eng degree in CS, Zhejiang University in 2015. -->

<!-- 1) developing multimodal learning algorithms (e.g., multimodal foundation model) to integrate multi-scale biomedical data for disease prevention, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment design; 2) building real-world learning systems to learn generalizable, trustworthy, and fair representations from imperfect medical data; and 3) developing causality-driven learning algorithms to improve their interpretability and safety for healthcare problems. -->
